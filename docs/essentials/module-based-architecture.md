## What Is Module Based Architecture?

Module Based Architecture (MBA) is a software architecture that uses modules to separate the functionality of a program into independent components. Modules are independent pieces of functionality that can be used to build a program. 

<span class="text-primary">IstanbulJS</span> strongly recommends object-oriented programming for medium and large scale applications. However, If your job is to just create a request listener, it provides you with a much softer infrastructure.

With module-based architecture, each object in your program becomes a module. Just like [`database normalization`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization). Product is an object and must be have a module. Category is an object and must have a module. This makes your programs more maintainable, readable, and flexible.

The most important features of <span class="text-primary">IstanbulJS</span> are that it is a flexible and progressive framework. and we owe this to module-based architecture. Because we used this philosophy while developing the framework.
